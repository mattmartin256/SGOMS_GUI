SGOMS GUI: An Interface for Developing SGOMS Models in ACTR
=========

This is the official repository for working versions of the SGOMS_GUI as well as the code documentation. 
The SGOMS_GUI is designed for creating SGOMS models that can be compiled into ACT-R code.
This tool is designed for use by the Carleton Cognitive Modeling lab, or anyone else who does SGOMS modeling.
See West and Somers (2011) for a description of SGOMS theory and how it is used.
